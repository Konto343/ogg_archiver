A downloader program that archives and downloads music in the OPUS codec from YouTube.

This program is meant to create music libraries from a list of target channel urls.

This little side-project was made as yt-dlp is too slow with archiving and didn't have custom logic I desired.

The folder structure or "library" made from using this program is best paired with Navidrome, a selfhosted music server.

Warning: This program will download music at a very *slow* rate (1 song per 1-2 minutes), to avoid YouTube's temporary IP bans and ratelimiting.
